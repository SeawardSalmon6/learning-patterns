# Design Patterns Learning Repository

Welcome to the **Design Patterns Learning Repository**! This project aims to explore and implement various design patterns to understand how they work, when to use them, and how to apply them in different programming languagesâ€”starting with TypeScript. The primary sources for this learning journey are [patterns.dev](https://patterns.dev) and the accompanying book.

## Objectives

- Learn the fundamentals of various design patterns.
- Understand the application and timing of each pattern.
- Implement each pattern in TypeScript.
- Create comprehensive READMEs for each pattern to aid others in learning.

## Introduction

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. This repository is dedicated to exploring these patterns, providing examples, explanations, and use cases to help developers understand and implement them effectively.

## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns
- Description: Patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms.
- Examples: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype.

### Structural Patterns
- Description: Patterns that deal with object composition.
- Examples: Adapter, Decorator, Proxy, Composite, Flyweight, Facade.

### Behavioral Patterns
- Description: Patterns that deal with object interaction and responsibility.
- Examples: Observer, Strategy, Command, State, Chain of Responsibility, Mediator, Memento, Visitor, Interpreter, Template Method.

Each pattern will have its own folder containing:
- An explanation of the pattern.
- When and why to use it.
- Implementation in TypeScript.
- Additional resources for further reading.

## How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add implementations in other languages, improve the existing examples, or provide additional explanations, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
